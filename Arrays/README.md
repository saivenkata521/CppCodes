# CppCodes

In this repository you will find some good c++ problems which were medium and hard in leetcode and geeksforgeeks


In some programms u will find ----> freopen("input.txt","r",stdin);
 
if we want to test our program with multiple test cases then 

1) create a text file(input.txt) in the same directory where the your current program is present 
2) Give the required input format for your code in it

with this type of input you can save more time 
otherwise you have to give input everytime when  our code executes
